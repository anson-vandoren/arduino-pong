## Step 1: Learn about the breadboard
The breadboard is an easy way to connect electronic components while youâ€™re testing out new ideas. It has regularly spaced holes that most circuit components will fit neatly into.
Inside the breadboard, the holes are connected to each other like this:

On the two outside edges, the holes connect left-to-right, shown by the blue and red lines. Usually, you use the blue row for the electrical negative (-), or ground connections, and the red row for the electrical positive (+) connections.
In the middle, the holes connect up-and-down, shown by the green lines. The holes are not connected across the divider area in the middle.
